-- Summer 2026 — Unified Time Log (hourly, UTC) with cross-program dedup
--
-- Port of spring_2026_analytics.unified_time_log, scoped to the Summer 2026
-- comparison set and extended with per-program run windows.
--
-- Programs:
--   stardance  — current Summer 2026 program (ongoing, launched ~2026-05-31).
--   flavortown — prior program (ran ~2025-12-24 to 2026-05-01), kept for the
--                historical comparison.
--   summer_of_making — Summer of Making 2025 (ran 2025-06-16 to 2025-10-02),
--                kept for the year-over-year historical comparison.
--   shipwrecked — Shipwrecked 2025 (ran ~2025-05-28 to 2025-09-03, island
--                event 2025-08-08..11), kept for the year-over-year
--                historical comparison.
--   siege      — Siege (ran 2025-08-31 to ~2026-04-07), kept for the
--                historical comparison.
--   athena_award — Athena Award (girls-focused, ran ~2025-05-21 to 2026-02,
--                Airtable-backed app), kept for the year-over-year
--                historical comparison.
--   neighborhood — Neighborhood 2025 (ran ~2025-05 to 2025-07), kept for
--                the year-over-year historical comparison.
--   blueprint  — hardware/PCB program (ongoing, launched ~2025-09-23).
--   hack_club_the_game — gamified ship-anything program (ongoing, beta opened
--                ~2026-01-16, first public approvals 2026-02-17).
--   construct  — 3D/modeling program (ongoing, app activity began 2025-12).
--   shiba      — game-making program (ran ~2025-08 to 2026-02), Airtable-backed.
--   midnight   — game-making program (ran ~2025-11 to 2026-04), Hackatime-backed.
--   stack, offtrack, beest, stasis, horizons — public Summer 2026 programs
--                with coding/work-session activity in their own app mirrors.
--   sleepover  — Airtable-backed program (ongoing, launched ~2026-01-16);
--                Hackatime-only, ported from spring_2026_analytics.
--   high_seas  — High Seas (winter 2024, ran ~2024-10 to 2025-01-31),
--                Airtable-backed; Hackatime claims via ships.wakatime_project_name.
--                Kept for the year-over-year historical comparison.
--   arcade     — Arcade (Summer 2024, ran ~2024-06 to 2024-09), Airtable-backed;
--                custom time from live "Hack Hour" session minutes.
--   juice      — Juice (Jan-May 2025, juice.hackclub.com), Airtable-backed;
--                custom time from live work "stretches".
--
-- Sources per program:
-- OUTPUT DAU COLUMNS (see section 8): every row carries dau and dau_deduped,
--   fractional weights that spread each person's "1" across their many rows so a
--   SUM() aggregates back to a headcount. dau is the within-program share
--   (SUM over a program-day = that program's distinct users); dau_deduped is the
--   across-all-programs share (SUM over a day = the unique overall DAU, SUM over
--   a program-day = the hours-weighted cross-program split). Stack dau_deduped
--   for a "unique overall DAU by program" chart.
--
--   Hackatime coding — global hackatime heartbeats, attributed to a program by
--                      the user's claimed project alias (user_hackatime_projects).
--   Custom logging   — program-native devlogs, journals, creator posts, and
--                      activity telemetry where those are the daily source.
--   Daily-grain /    — programs whose native source is not hourly Hackatime or
--   activity-only      custom time: macondo (daily_project_activity rollup),
--                      horizons app-native daily activity (from 2026-04-22),
--                      fallout (hardware build timelapses + journals), and
--                      highway (GitHub commit days, no durations). Added in
--                      section 6b; see there for grain/identity/dedup handling.
--                      This makes the model the single activity log for every
--                      Summer 2026 program.
--
-- DEDUP (equal split), inspired by spring:
--   If the same coding hour is claimed by multiple programs — either because the
--   same (hour, user, alias) is claimed by >1 program, OR because a project's
--   repo URL is shared across >1 program on the same day — the raw hours are
--   divided equally among them. credited_hours_logged = raw_hours_logged /
--   split_factor, where split_factor = GREATEST(alias_claim_count, url_program
--   _count). This keeps a single coding session from inflating multiple programs.
--
--   WINDOW-AWARE: unlike spring (which assumes every program is concurrently
--   live), dedup here only counts a program for an hour it is actually in-window
--   for, and URL overlap is scoped to the same calendar day. This is required
--   because the comparison set mixes a finished program (flavortown) with a live
--   one (stardance): a Hackatime alias never "unclaims", so without window-gating
--   a user who claimed the same alias in both would have stardance's current hours
--   wrongly split with — and flavortown wrongly kept alive by — the dead program.
--   The two run windows share no day, so nothing splits between them today; once
--   genuinely concurrent Summer programs are added, real overlaps split correctly.

-- Blueprint (hardware/PCB) logs self-reported time as journal entries, keyed
-- off created_at (there is no separate work timestamp). Blueprint has no
-- Hackatime integration (projects.hackatime_project_keys exists but is empty
-- for all 14.5k projects), so journals are its only time source.
--
-- DURATION SEMANTICS: the journal form asks "How many hours did you spend
-- since the last journal?", so an entry banks ALL time since the user's
-- previous post onto the posting date (same lumping as SoM devlogs). The app
-- enforces no server-side validation on duration_seconds (client-side max is
-- 1000h), so the data holds 999h test entries (incl. admin tests on live
-- projects), first-entry "whole project so far" dumps (avg 76h), and same-day
-- repeat-entry inflation (avg 154h/entry; one user: 81 templated 5h entries
-- in 4 hours). Reviewers set hours_override at review time and never sanitize
-- journal durations, so there is no cleaner ground truth to redistribute with.
--
-- Quality controls (audited 2026-06):
--   * banned users excluded — 65 banned users held 4.1% of hours.
--   * each entry is capped at 24h AND each user-day is proportionally rescaled
--     to a 24h total (entry spam reached 400h/user-day with only the per-entry
--     cap). The cap also truncates honest multi-week banked entries to 24h on
--     their posting day — accepted, since real and fabricated >24h claims are
--     indistinguishable here. DAU is unaffected by either cap.
--   * all entries are authored by the project owner (review-linked entries are
--     the owner's milestone submissions, verified by_other=0), and exact-dupe
--     entries are zero, so no further dedup is needed.

-- Milkyway (game-making) tracks art time as artlogs: self-reported hours

-- hours are credited (the reviewer pipeline approved 787 of 1,197 raw hours
-- but reviews lag and rejected hours are not adjudicated fraud, matching the
-- stasis/stack precedent of crediting claimed time). Devlogs are NOT counted:
-- devlogs.code_hours banks Hackatime time and devlogs.art_hours banks artlog
-- time accrued since the previous post (SoM double-count rationale), and
-- devlogs only existed 2025-11-17..2026-01-06 anyway.

--   * the app validates entries server-side (max observed 21h, p99 7.9h,

-- via the DLT junction table. Ported from spring_2026_analytics, which is the

--   * the base has no ban/fraud flag. verification_status is an identity-
--     verification state, not a fraud signal; 'ineligible' users hold 2 of

--   * scale re-audit: claimed aliases carry 10,586 lifetime Hackatime hours;
--     program-start gating counts 9,236 raw hours / 559 users; the old
--     projects.created_at gate counted only 3,345 raw hours / 447 users. At
--     project grain, banked projects.hours total 14,375; duplicated aliases

-- Moonshot (moonshot.hackclub.com, ended Dec 2025) is the same Prisma schema as
-- Shipwrecked: HackatimeProjectLink attaches Hackatime aliases to projects (one
-- row per alias), and Project has no timestamp columns. Hackatime is the only
-- time source — the link's rawHours/hoursOverride are banked/reviewer-adjusted
-- Hackatime totals (counting them would double count, SoM rationale), and
-- User.purchasedProgressHours is shop-bought progress, not time. Identity is the
-- user's normalized email (present for all 2,338 users).
--
-- claim_start_ts is the program launch (2025-10-25, first link row), not each
-- link's createdAt: links were created 2025-10-25..2026-03 as people joined, and
-- gating on the link timestamp would drop legitimate in-window coding done before
-- a participant linked. The CLOSED program window does the real gating.
--
-- Quality controls (audited 2026-06-14):
--   * User.status = 'FraudSuspect' is the program's fraud flag (UserStatus enum:
--     Unknown/L1/L2/FraudSuspect) — excluded, mirroring Shipwrecked. 0 users are
--     FraudSuspect today, but the gate is kept as a future-proof exclusion.
--   * identity-join coverage: 336 of 351 alias-claiming users (95.7%) have

-- truncated to 24h on the posting day (same trade-off blueprint documents).
-- DAU is unaffected by the cap. The cap applies per logging path: a user-day

-- 6b. DAILY-GRAIN & ACTIVITY-ONLY SOURCES
--     Programs whose native activity source is not hourly Hackatime/custom
--     time. These bypass the hourly alias/URL dedup (they expose no shared
--     alias or repo URL) and the 24h/user-day cap (their upstreams already
--     cap or aggregate), so each row is added pre-split: split_factor=1,
--     overlap_type='none'. Each carries a distinct logging_method token so
--     daily_active_users can recover its DAU methodology label.
--
--     Identity is the normalized participant email wherever the source can
--     bridge to one, so these users dedup against the coding programs in
--     daily_active_users_deduped. macondo/horizons fall back to a stable
--     program:user_id key when no email exists (cannot cross-program dedup,
--     but DAU/hours are preserved); fallout/highway keep NULL for unmatched
--     users (dropped from DAU by COUNT(DISTINCT), matching their prior
--     program-native models).
-- ============================================================

-- Hour spine for daily-grain sources. They only know the calendar day, so rather
-- than spike a person's whole day at 00:00 UTC we spread the attribution evenly
-- across all 24 hours (1/24 of the hours per hourly row). The downstream DAU
-- weights still reconcile — a person-day's rows sum to their hours/day-total no
-- matter how many rows it is split into. raw/credited hours are rounded to 6dp so
-- 24 × (hours/24) recovers the day total to well within the test tolerances.
